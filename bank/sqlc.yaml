# Why SQLC over ORM?
# Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys requires you to use SQL anyway.
# if you need to know SQL to use an ORM, why not just use SQL directly?
# it prevents the need to know how this ORM works (how it translate non-SQL to SQL), and how to use it.

# SQLC is like protobuf for SQL - it generates code from a schema file in to functions.
